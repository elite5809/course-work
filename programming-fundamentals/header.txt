* ==============================================================
* Project: Final Project - Tron Light Racer
* Description: An arena-style game using light bikes to eliminate your opponents
* Documentation Statement: 
*   I used this youtube playlist to learn how to use ncurses
*   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2U2TQ__OrQ8jTf0_noNKtHMuYlyxQl4v
* ==============================================================
* UserManual/Instructions:
*   To build the game, ensure that PDCurses3.9 folder is in the root directory.
*   As for how to play the game, the instructions are in the game itself.
 *
 *  Bonus Features (upto 10 pts) - List here
 *  1) Using a main menu
 *  2) Getting color in terminal
 *  3) Status bar at the bottom of the game
 *
 *  Required Programming Skills (must have 5 of 6):
 *   1) Dynamic Memory Allocation
 *          What you did to meet this req: I dynamically allocated memory for key presses to ensure the pointer doesnt run out taking in key presses per frame
 *              File: main.c
 *              Line#: 369 - 375
 *   2) Pointers
 *          What you did to meet this req: I initialized my ncurses windows and player list as pointers
 *              File: main.c
 *              Line#: 3-5
 *   3) File I/O
 *          What you did to meet this req: I have a loadNames and saveNames which saves to a text file
 *              File: main.c
 *              Line#: 285 - 295
 *   4) Structs
 *          What you did to meet this req: Made a struct for a player type
 *              File: main.h
 *              Line#: 12-19
 *
 *   5) String Manipulation
 *          What you did to meet this req: xxx
 *              File: 
 *              Line#: 
 *
 *   6) Processing of Array Data
 *          What you did to meet this req: Gathered all key strokes made during the frame and processed them through a switch case
 *              File: main.c
 *              Line#: 377-437
 *
 *  Required Advanced Programming Skills (1 or more):
 *   1) Recursion
 *          What you did to meet this req: xxx
 *              File: 
 *              Line#: 
 *
 *   2) 2D Dynamic Memory
 *          What you did to meet this req: Both my names variable and gameArena use this
 *              File: main.c
 *              Line#: 23-24, 328-330
 *
 *   3) Graphics - Curses or Win32
 *          What you did to meet this req: Used ncurses
 *              File: main.c
 *              Line#: Found throughout code but initialized at 68-75 (initProgram)
 *
 *   List any changes or omissions from stated shall requirements (from
 *   your design) also describe any functionality that isn't working.
 *      Requirement changes/omissions:
 *          1) Consolidated updating visuals into updateScreen()
 *          2) Added killColor() function - once a player dies, deletes their bike and light walls
 *          3) Added initColors to consolidate the ncurses color pairs initialization
 *
 *      Errors:
 *          1) No errors
 *          2) 5 warnings about unsafe functions and 2 warnings about unreachable code that does work
 *
 *   How many hours did you spend on this project: 
 *   How many lines of code did you write in total:
