# Final Project

The purpose of this project was for students to apply their knowledge of CNNs onto a StarCraft II scenario and build a CNN model that would most efficiently build a base (using pre-determined actions) and destroy the enemy as quickly as possible. There was some starter code given for this project, and the majority of the code modification is found in `build_marines_agent.py`.
